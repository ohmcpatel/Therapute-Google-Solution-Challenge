We have kept scalability and ease-of-use for our users in mind while developing Therapute's Frontend. We utilize Next.js and React.js as our main frameworks to help us achieve this goal.

**Frontend with Next.js**
- Server-Side Rendering: Render pages on the server to improve load times
- Static Site Generation: Pre-generates static pages during build for faster performance
- API Routes: Implements backend logic allowing seemless integration with frontend

**React.js**
- Component-based Architecture: Improves maintability and scalability
- Enhances performance by only updating changed parts of the UI.
